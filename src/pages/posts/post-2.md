# ChatGPT's bed time story 
## (extremely entertaining and above all ... I dunno)
Published on: 2050-13-32, 23:18


In the depths of the ocean, there lived a unique superhero known as Sharky, who had a peculiar mission: to promote dental hygiene among marine creatures.
Armed with a toothbrush and minty-fresh toothpaste, Sharky roamed the seas, searching for fellow sea creatures with neglected dental care.
With lightning speed, Sharky would swoop in to rescue any tooth-troubled fish, using his gentle yet effective brushing techniques to save the day.
Despite his fearsome appearance, Sharky was loved and admired by all sea creatures for his dedication to their dental health.
And so, with a sparkling smile and a wave of gratitude, the ocean remained a cleaner and brighter place thanks to the heroic efforts of Sharky, the tooth-brushing shark superhero.

Brush your teeth, 

Good night and sleep tight,
