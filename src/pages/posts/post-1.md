# First ever post ... partparty


Published on: 2050-13-32, 23:17

Dear dear diary,
Yesterday I dreamed about sitting on a flying elephant and drinking a cup of tea made from diluted wine. It was really interesting.
I'm not sure about what signs this dream is giving me. Either that I should look at my life from above to get an overview, or maybe just that I from now on should drink deluted wine tea like people long long a go did (to not die of bacteria in the water, alcohol as a healing liquid (quite something else than what it's properties are used for today)). The second option does sound a lot more intriguing...

Maybe diluted wine tea is the solution to all world problems, who knows. Learned a lot from this dream 10/10 would recommend
Hopefully tomorrows dream is gonna be a banger. We'll see, we'll see. 

With kind regards,
God
