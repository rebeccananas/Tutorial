Now, 10 years before my last post, Nothing makes sence. What the fuck is chatGPT and why a story about a shark and a tooth brush. I hope it's not some kind of proficy, that would be interesting...

Now, today I Thought I would share some lyrics from Nick cave with the world. Because a day without reading NIck Cave lyrics is a day not lived. One of my personal favourite songs of his latest music is called "Waiting for you' :). One problem... I have no idea how copyright works, so you can check out the lyrics here: https://www.nickcave.com/lyric/waiting-for-you/
