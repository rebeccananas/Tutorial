Now, 10 years before my last post, Nothing makes sence. What the fuck is chatGPT and why a story about a shark and a tooth brush. I hope it's not some kind of proficy, that would be interesting...

Now, today I Thought I would share some lyrics from Nick cavewith the world. Because a day without reading NIck Cave lyrics is a day not lived. One of my personal favourite songs of his latest music :)

## For y'all to enjoy: Waiting for you by Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds
All through the night we drove and the wind caught her hair

And we parked on the beach in the cool evening air

Well, sometimes it's better not to say anything at all

Your body is an anchor, never asked to be free

Just want to stay in the business of making you happy

Well I'm just waiting for you

Waiting for you (5x)

A priest runs through the chapel, all the calendars are turning

A Jesus freak on the street says He is returning

Well sometimes a little bit of faith can go a long, long way

Your soul is my anchor, never asked to be freed

Well sleep now, sleep now, take as long as you need

'Cause I'm just waiting for you

Waiting for you (5x)

To return (3x)
