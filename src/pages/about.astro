        <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

        <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

        <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>


        <p>PS. I just copied this text from the astro tutorial and I know it's kinda boring. On the other pages i'll try to be a bit more interesting, because why not ... i guess.</p>
